# Unet-with-Fuzzy-Layer
In this repo, we modify the simple Unet structure and add a fuzzy-layer block in the middle of the original unet structure. Totally, we have two datasets to test, which is cityscape and DRIVE datasets. Both of them are open-source and due to the limited storage space, i only upload the DRIVE datasets.
